The project emphasizes the need for secure and trustworthy data in supply chains, facilitated by blockchain technology.
It resolves challenges of traditional supply chain systems, such as hidden organizational layers and transparency issues. 
It also focuses on implementing a permissionless blockchain to handle transactions and data securely and transparently.

The solution involves developing a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode called Supply Chain Ledger Network (SCLN). The implementation requires tools like Ubuntu, Python, Git, Docker, and Node.js. 
The projectâ€™s structure includes cryptographic configurations and smart contracts to manage transactions between manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers.
